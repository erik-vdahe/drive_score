# Drive Score

Drive score is an attempt to find a middle ground in evaluation NFL teams. At one end we have the macro view, looking only at points scored (e.g., Simple Rating System) and at the other we have ratings based on play by play data (e.g., DVOA). Perhaps a middle ground, basing the rating on the success of drives will also result in a meaningful metric.
